# FluffyCloudShader
A simple shader which creates fluffy looking clouds. Sort of cartoony.
It has a bug because it uses world position to generate the different effect of the fluffyness. The world position means the cloud changes it fluffy
shape based on where it is in the world. This creates a bug when the cloud moves it changes shapes slightly every time.
